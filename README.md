# CNN-Exercises

This repository contains code for a small image classification exercise using a dataset obtained from Roboflow. The dataset consists of two classes: Cat and Rabbit. Each class has a specific number of images allocated for training, testing, and validation. All images have a size of 300x300 pixels.

This is a practice exercise to learn and experiment with image classification techniques. It's not a full project, just a way to practice and improve my skills here.
